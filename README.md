# Implementation Patterns in C++

This repository contains basic implementation patterns in C++ intended for studying and understanding fundamental concepts. The examples here are simplified and designed to focus on core ideas rather than complex use cases.

## Structure

The repository is divided into three main parts:

1. **Befehl_Implementation_Pattern**  
   This folder demonstrates the Command design pattern (`Befehl` translates to "Command" in German). It showcases how commands can be encapsulated as objects to decouple request invocations from their execution.

2. **Pubsub-template**  
   This folder includes an example of a Publish-Subscribe (PubSub) template, a messaging pattern used for event-driven programming.

3. **Watcher-template**  
   This folder includes an example of a Watcher template, a pattern similar to PubSub, but more general. So You can use this more often.

## Note
You may notice some German words (e.g., "Befehl") in the code or filenames. We apologize for this inconsistencyâ€”it reflects the original development process. Feel free to treat these as part of the learning experience!

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Implementationpatterns.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired pattern folder (e.g., `Befehl_Implementation_Pattern`) and build the project using the provided `Makefile`:
   ```bash
   cd Befehl_Implementation_Pattern
   make
   ```

3. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./main
   ```

4. Clean up the build files:
   ```bash
   make clean
   ```

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Provide simple examples of widely used implementation patterns in C++.
- Serve as a reference for beginners to understand design patterns and coding practices.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you would like to improve the examples, translate terms into English, or add new patterns, feel free to create a pull request.
